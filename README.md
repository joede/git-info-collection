# JOEDE's Git information collection

Wow... Sounds important. But it is much easier. ;-)

This is a simple collection of small but interesting information about Git.
To keep it in one place and to manage these information with Git, I've
created this repository.

If you have some more tipps which I can add to one of the files, feel free
to send me a note or a *pull request*.
